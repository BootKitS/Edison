If you are not interested in compiling it yourself just grab the binary from bin/debug! Please note that most samples are packed and before you can use this tool you should have the dumped sample. You may use [HollowsHunter](https://github.com/hasherezade/hollows_hunter).

Another approach which might be cool is described here:
